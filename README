This folder contains the methods used in the work "On the Combination of Domain-Specific Heuristics for Author Name Disambiguation â€“ The Nearest Cluster Method".

The SAND method uses the LAC (Lazy Associative Classifier) implementation available in 'SLAND/lac' folder.

The methods LASVMDBSCAN, SVM, SLAND and SAND need a 'config.properties' file in order to define the path to external tools and to temporary folders.

More details of each method can be found in the class 'classifier.Main'.

The original code can be downloaded directly from the web of the authors in the following link: http://www.lbd.dcc.ufmg.br/lbd/collections
